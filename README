IN PROGRESS. THIS IS NO FINAL PRODUCT. If you contact me saying the game lacks gameplay, you are bad, and should feel bad to</meme>

Anyways, this is my current game project. If you want to follow the progress, go ahead! If you want to fix bugs, or even add stuff, go ahead! Add a pull-request. And you will get your name in the credits under "Contributors", and the number of lines you have contributed.
This game IS open source, so enjoy peeking the code and nagging me about not following the Java standards, or having slow graphics. Any feedback is good!

NOTE:

This game will soon have a bugtracker that sends any errors to me so i can fix them. If you play the game, you agree to let the game send any error, and info about how it happened, to my server, so i can analyze it and try to fix it.
